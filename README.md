Dalgona Coffee is a cold latte drink that comes with a velvety smooth and sweet coffee foam on top. 
The combination of cold milk and the bittersweet coffee is simply a match made in heaven. 
And the best part is that you can make it without any special machines – all you need is some arm muscle and patience.<br><br>

Dalgona Coffee is the latest big trend in Korea – especially in these strange times of so many being quarantined at home
 due to the Coronavirus epidemic. I even watched a video of a Korean grandma trying to make the foam with just a spoon… 
lol.. and she was not happy because it was taking so looong..
<br><br>
Now, why is it called Dalgona Coffee?? The sweet and bitter taste of the coffee foam has is very similar to Dalgona,
 and the color too – hence the name. 
<br><br>I think it’s a perfect drink for people who miss going to coffee shops and also
 who have some extra time on their hands. Make this and it will definitely put a smile on your face because it 
tastes as good as it looks.

And we certainly all have some extra time on our hands, don’t we??? Well, when life gives you lemons..you 
know the rest..haha.<br><br>

So, I made this in about 10 times in all – to experiment using different methods and ingredients and also because
 I would forget to take video or photo of a certain step…  I have to say, it didn’t work the first couple times but
 I worked everything out now and you will succeed – if you follow my instructions precisely.
